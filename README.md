# Uncommon Expo Camera and BarCodeScanner Bugs

This repository demonstrates and provides solutions for uncommon bugs encountered when using the Expo Camera and BarCodeScanner components.  These bugs manifest under specific configurations and usage patterns, leading to unexpected behavior such as camera initialization failures, blank screens, and inconsistent barcode scanning.

## Bugs:

* **Camera Initialization Failure:**  The camera fails to initialize correctly when using specific props like `type="front"` and particular `flashMode` settings.
* **Inconsistent BarCodeScanning:** The `onBarCodeScanned` callback does not trigger reliably under various circumstances, causing intermittent errors.

## Solutions:

The `bugSolution.js` file provides modified code that addresses the identified issues.  Key improvements involve more robust error handling and careful consideration of prop combinations to mitigate camera and barcode scanner malfunctions.
