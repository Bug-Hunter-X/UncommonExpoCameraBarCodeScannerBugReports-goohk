This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with specific props and configurations, resulting in unexpected behavior or crashes.  For instance, setting `type` to `front` and certain `flashMode` options might lead to the camera failing to initialize or displaying a blank screen.  Another issue involves using `barCodeScanner` with custom `onBarCodeScanned` functionality which may not trigger consistently under certain conditions. This often results in the application freezing or producing intermittent errors in the console relating to camera access or permissions.
